# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch


Ml algorithms that I wrote from scratch will be here in time.

Algorithms that will be:

+ KNN for Classification and Regression
+ Linear, multiple linear, polynomial regression
+ Logistic Regression
+ Support Vector Machines / Support Vector Regression
+ Decision Trees for Classification and Regression
+ Random Forest
+ Naive Bayes
+ Regularization Algorithms: 

  * Ridge Regression
  * Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)
  * Elastic Net
